public class Employee {

    public String name;

    public static  String company = "Veridian Dynamics";

    public String displayEmployeeInfo(){
        return name + " works at " + company;
    }

    public Employee(){ // every time a employee is created it will sout
        System.out.println("We have a new employee!");
    }
}

//    Create an Employee class. The employee class should have a name instance variable, a static company variable set to Veridian Dynamics, and a non-static method displayEmployeeInfo(). displayEmployeeInfo() should generate a string, name + " works at " + company. Create a test class that instantiates three employee objects with different names. Run displayEmployeeInfo on all of them to show that each has access to the employee static variable. Bonus: write a method that has the employee emit a random quote and test it.
